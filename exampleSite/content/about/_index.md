# About TWIN project

**TWIN** is an Erasmus+ project that aims to empower small and medium-sized enterprises across Europe to become digitally ready, environmentally responsible, and competitively resilient.

Rooted in the dual priorities of the EU—digital transformation and green transition—the project equips SMEs with the knowledge, tools, and training necessary to successfully navigate the challenges and opportunities of modern business ecosystems.

Our work focuses on enabling SMEs to embrace emerging technologies, strengthen digital security, adopt eco-friendly practices, and build sustainable competitive strategies for the future economy.

## MOTIVATION

The **European Green Deal** and the EU's **Digital Decade** highlight an urgent need: SMEs must evolve to remain competitive, sustainable, and future-proof.

However, many SMEs across Europe still face barriers such as:

- Limited digital readiness
- Lack of access to information and training
- Low awareness of green transformation benefits
- Insufficient resources for digital upskilling

The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated digital requirements and exposed gaps in resilience and preparedness. SMEs—being the backbone of the European economy—must be supported to adapt, innovate, and thrive.

The TWIN project is motivated by the belief that **digitalization and sustainability are not challenges to overcome—but opportunities to grow**.

## BACKGROUND

Digital transformation and sustainability are reshaping global markets. SMEs produce significant value for European societies, yet many still struggle to adopt innovative solutions or integrate sustainable practices.

Key realities shaping the project include:

- Digital transformation is essential for competitiveness and future-proofing
- Green transition aligns with cost-efficiency, customer expectations, and EU policy
- SMEs need support to understand risks, opportunities, and practical pathways
- Unequal digital maturity across regions threatens economic cohesion

The TWIN project builds a research-based, training-driven, and tool-supported model combining both transitions into an actionable roadmap (**G.R.O.W.T.H. framework**).
