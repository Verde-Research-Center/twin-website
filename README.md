## 💡 Motivation

The **European Green Deal** and the EU's **Digital Decade** highlight an urgent need: SMEs must evolve to remain competitive, sustainable, and future-proof.

However, many SMEs across Europe still face barriers such as:

- Limited digital readiness
- Lack of access to information and training
- Low awareness of green transformation benefits
- Insufficient resources for digital upskilling

The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated digital requirements and exposed gaps in resilience and preparedness. SMEs—being the backbone of the European economy—must be supported to adapt, innovate, and thrive.

The TWIN project is motivated by the belief that **digitalization and sustainability are not challenges to overcome—but opportunities to grow**.
